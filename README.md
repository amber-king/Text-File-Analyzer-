# Text File Analyzer üìÇüóÑÔ∏è

 
A simple text file analyzer that can be used to analyze text files and display the results in a table - *Python based*


## Features:

* Counts the total number of words in the file. <i>(Word count)
* Counts the total number of characters in the file.<i>(Character count)
* Counts the total number of lines in the file.<i>(Line Count)
* Finds the number of occurrences of a specific word or phrase.<i>(Specific Word)

How to Use:
1. Save the script:

    - Save the script as a Python file (e.g., text_analyzer.py) in your desired location.
    <br>

2. Open a terminal/command prompt:

    - Most IDEs have built-in terminals. Alternatively, use an external terminal application.
    <br>

3. Navigate to the directory:

    - Use the cd command in your terminal to change directories to where you saved the script. For example:


### Bash
```
cd Documents  # Assuming you saved it in Documents
```
<br>

4. Execute the script (depending on your operating system):

    - Windows:


        ###  Bash
        ```
        python text_analyzer.py

        ```

    - macOS/Linux:

        ### Bash
        ```
        python3 text_analyzer.py
        ```
<br>





<br>

**Example Output:**

```
Word Count: 150
Character Count: 850
Line Count: 10
Specific Word Count ('your_word'): 3
```
<br>

**Note:**

* Replace `"your_file.txt"` with the actual name of your text file.

* python or python3 textreader.py "your_file.txt" -- check your python version prior to seeing which command works best for your local device.

<br>

## **Further Enhancements:**

* Allow users to specify the text file name as a command-line argument instead of requiring it within the script.
* Make the program case-insensitive for word counting.
* Add functionality to find multiple words or phrases.
* Add GUI functionality either through Python or different script language.<i>(GUI file attempt is included for your own workings and try's at debugging it, Good Luck if you choose to give it a try üòÅ)
